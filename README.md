# Assignment 1.2

Create a private repository named mle-training with an empty README.md


Create a GitHub issue for the current assignment and add in the details based on what is requested in this assignment and assign it to yourself. Note the issue-id. 


Create a new branch (enh/<issue-id>/<short-msg>) and copy the code-snippet here and commit as-is including the README. Use appropriate commit messages as per the guidelines.


Add a .gitignore file to the repository to avoid committing unnecessary files like pyc files and the CSV data files in your current folder.  

Use Conda to set up a python development environment named mle-dev to run the script. Export the environments file as env.yml and commit it to the repository.


# Steps:
conda create -n mle-dev
conda env export > env.yml
